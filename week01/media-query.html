                1 Timothy 4: 2-4
            </h2>
            <p>
                2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their consciense seared with a hot iron;
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, it it be received with thanksgiving

            <h2>
                2 Timothy 3: 7-9
            </h2>
            <p>
                7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.
